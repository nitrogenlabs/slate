# Getting Started

## Source files

### Github
The ArkhamJS project is regularly maintained on GitHub. All contributions, and suggested features are welcome. 

### Download the Zip
Although we recommend installing the node module, you may access the source files by downloading the latest [.zip](https://github.com/nitrogenlabs/arkhamjs/archive/master.zip) (~25kb).


## Installation

### ArkhamJS

> Install ArkhamJS

```javascript
// Install using npm:
$ npm install --save arkhamjs

// Install using yarn:
$ yarn add arkhamjs
```

```typescript
// Install using npm:
$ npm install --save arkhamjs

// Install using yarn:
$ yarn add arkhamjs
```

ArkhamJS can be used in all modern browsers as well as within NodeJS and React Native apps.


## Importing

```javascript
// Import for ArkhamJS
import {Flux} from 'arkhamjs';
```

```typescript
// Import for ArkhamJS
import {Flux} from 'arkhamjs';
```

Then with a module bundler like webpack that supports either CommonJS or ES2015 modules, use as you would anything else:

## Starter Skeletons

For the quickest way to get started, we setup a skeleton to get started. Get the latest version and have a sample site up within minutes!

 * React [.zip](https://github.com/nitrogenlabs/arkhamjs-skeleton-react/archive/master.zip) [Documentation](https://github.com/nitrogenlabs/arkhamjs-skeleton-react) 

The projects are complete with a pre-existing file structure, sample layout views, components, and even server setup with Webpack.
