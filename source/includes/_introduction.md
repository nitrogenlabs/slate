# Introduction

Styles are always a common topic for developers. We've constructed a style guide that helps eliminate the use of styles as a preference and, instead, defines the use of styles in regards to untilization from various developers. Guides and rules are given along with reasons why to help keep code clean, consistent, and future-proof.

## Philosophy

Our philosophy is to write better code, consistent code over worring about larger commits. Code should be legible, easy to read, fully commented, and optimized. Size of code commits/push requests/code reviews should not be a concern. Refactoring code as it is being worked on, even when out of scope, is always encouraged. If the concern is breaking code, this is the reason we have unit tests. Some styling preferences try to reduce merge conflicts, this is the same misguided step as when we code just to test.

## Conditional Learning

Classical conditioning involves automatic or reflexive responses, and not voluntary behavior. This means the only responses that can be elicited out of a classical conditioning paradigm are ones that rely on responses that are naturally made, being trained. 

When a developer is writing code, if the code style rules contradict one another or has conditions, it slows down development. The brain must first solve the problem, translate the mental solution into a snippet of code, then write it down. The faster a developer can transcribe that code into the editor, the faster they can code. When code styling (aka linting) rules are consistent and do not have conditions on when to use, the developer can maintain the trained classic conditioning of the style guide and write without thinking. 

## ES6/7 and TypeScript

The rules set forth allow for easier transition to ES6/7 as well as TypeScript.
