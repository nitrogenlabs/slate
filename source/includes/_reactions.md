# Reactions

The third and final piece are the reactions. Reactions are most commonly known as the view layer but can also be components with no view. Services, utilities, and functional components can be included in this category as well.

This is where data updates are initiated. All updates are triggered by some time of user interaction, timer, or server response.


## React and React Native

The view layer is created by React. React has a fast and concise rendering algorithm -- which was even further refined in React 16 with React Fiber. Making re-rendering isloated to only those components that need to be updated.
