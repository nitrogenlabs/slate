# Introduction

Styles are always a common topic for developers. We've constructed a style guide
that helps eliminate the use of styles as a preference and, instead, defines the
use of styles in regards to untilization from various developers. Guides and
rules are given along with reasons why to help keep code clean, consistent, and
future-proof.
